# Comprehensive-Data-Analysis-and-Multiclass-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

## Project Overview

This project involves a thorough data analysis followed by the application of various deep learning models to perform multiclass classification. The dataset used includes both numerical and categorical features, with the target variable being 'PRICE'. The key steps undertaken in this project are:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
2. **Univariate Analysis**
3. **Bivariate Analysis**
4. **Outlier Removal using Capping**
5. **Data Visualization**
6. **Model Building and Training**
7. **Model Evaluation**
8. **Comparison of Various Models**

## Univariate Analysis

- **Numerical Columns**: Analyzed the distribution and statistical properties of each numerical feature. Removed outliers using capping techniques.
- **Categorical Columns**: Analyzed the frequency distribution of categorical features.

## Bivariate Analysis

- Performed analysis to understand the relationship between pairs of variables, particularly between features and the target variable.

## Data Preprocessing

- Converted categorical variables into dummy variables.
- Standardized numerical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

## Models Applied

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

## Model Training and Evaluation

- Used callbacks such as Early Stopping and Model Checkpointing to save the best model.
- Evaluated models using metrics such as loss, accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Results

- Achieved high accuracy with the LSTM model.
- Detailed performance metrics for each model are provided in the respective sections.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of comprehensive data analysis before applying deep learning models. By performing both univariate and bivariate analyses and carefully preprocessing the data, we were able to build effective models for multiclass classification.
